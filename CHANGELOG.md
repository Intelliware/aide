# A.I.D.E. (AI Integrated Delivery Enablement) — CHANGELOG

> Project-level release-stream change log.
> **Audience:** end users / downstream consumers of A.I.D.E. — not internal SDLC participants (those use per-package CHANGE-TRACKER.md).
> **Format:** Keep-a-Changelog over the canonical change-log block (`templates/blocks/shared/change-log.md`) wrapped by `templates/compositions/project-change-log.yaml`. **This file dogfoods F-007.**

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Artifact | A.I.D.E. — release stream |
| Artifact type | project-change-log |
| Current artifact version | `1.0.0` |
| Versioning convention | Semver (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) |
| Stage / Skill of record | (project-level — managed by `create-pr` step 6 going forward) |

## Versioning convention

A.I.D.E. uses semver:

- **MAJOR** — breaking changes to the skill catalogue, SKILL.md frontmatter shape, composition / block contracts, project.toml schema. Migration steps required.
- **MINOR** — new skills, new compositions, new schema fields, new validator checks. Backwards-compatible for existing projects.
- **PATCH** — bug fixes, doc updates, validator allowlists, non-breaking SKILL.md / step-file edits.

## Parts Affected — Reference (project-level vocabulary)

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `validator` | `scripts/validate.py` and `scripts/build-registry.py` |
| `skills` | Anything under `.agents/skills/` |
| `compositions` | Anything under `templates/compositions/` |
| `blocks` | Anything under `templates/blocks/` |
| `config` | `config/` (schemas + example files) |
| `references` | Top-level `references/` (cross-cutting framework references) |
| `branding` | Repo-wide naming, top-level identity files |
| `docs` | `_docs/` (framework-internal documentation) |
| `Multiple` | When more than two of the above apply |

## Change Types

Standard change-log block taxonomy. Project-level changelog maps these to Keep-a-Changelog categories at presentation time:

| Change Type | Keep-a-Changelog category |
|---|---|
| Initial Extraction | Added |
| Addition | Added |
| Source Update | Changed |
| Restructure | Changed |
| Correction | Fixed |
| Deprecation | Deprecated |
| Removal | Removed |

### `0.x` — pre-1.0 history (compressed)

Pre-1.0 work was not formally versioned. The git log under the previous repo name (`theframework`) carries the per-commit history. Notable milestones, in chronological order:

- **Migration foundation** — skills consolidated under `.agents/skills/`, AGENTS.md authored, host setup simplified.
- **Cursor IDE host support** — host-comparison cheatsheet authored.
- **Stage-mapping reference docs** — `_docs/` set authored to track archive→current stage mapping.
- **BMAD methodology committed** — `_bmad/` brought into version control as a methodology input (config.user.toml gitignored per F-006-style convention).
- **End-to-end test pass** — all 32 skills exercised across 5 phases (A–E); 7 findings raised and resolved:
    - F-001 — validator phase-vocab allowlist via per-file pragma
    - F-002 — Check A widened to count direct skill-markdown refs
    - F-003 — test-plan B.4 pass criterion aligned to SKILL.md
    - F-004 — stale change-tracker-template cross-references corrected
    - F-005 — RE output bound to composition block lists; validator Check H added
    - F-006 — `build-knowledge-base` fail-loud on empty `[[project.repos]]`
    - F-007 — project-level CHANGELOG.md support (the work this file is the first instance of)
- **Test-plan tightened** — Phase A / Phase C / Phase D.10 pass criteria updated to reflect the post-fix framework state.

The 1.0.0 entry above marks the formal start of versioned releases.

## Cross-Part / Cross-Section Synchronisation

| If This Changes... | Check This... |
|---|---|
| README version line | This CHANGELOG's "Current artifact version" cell |
| Block / composition contracts | Update validator checks accordingly; bump MAJOR if breaking |
| Project.toml schema | Update `config/SCHEMAS.md` and `config/project.toml.example` together; bump MINOR for additive fields, MAJOR for breaks |
| New skill added or skill removed | Bump MINOR; record under Added or Removed; rebuild registry |
| Skill description edited | Rebuild registry (`scripts/build-registry.py`); record under Changed |
